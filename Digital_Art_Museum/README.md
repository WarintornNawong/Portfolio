# Digital Art Museum
## Introduction 
In this project, I would like to produce a digital art from the place where i was born - "Chonburi" to be a tools to enable  benefit for user who implement this for example, to be an idea/ creativity for campaigner in tourist attraction or any related activities of this province such as government activities etc.

**Chonburi**, Bangkok’s nearest seaside town, is located on the eastern coast of the Gulf of Thailand with 1.4 million residents 
million residents, only 80 kilometres from the capital. Neighbouring provinces are Chachoengsao, Chanthaburi, and Rayong, while the Gulf of Thailand is to the west. The area are full with abundant natural resources, which are highlighted by delightful Beaches, local traditions, regional delicacies, and fresh Seafood. This is a popular coastal province among Bangkokians who seek the nearest escape from hectic weekly schedules, escaping particularly frequently to the seaside resort of Pattaya. In addition to tourism, Chonburi is the centre of the Eastern Seaboard Development Project, with its industrial parks and Fishing villages.

According to The Nation, Tourist Industry in Chonburi accounts for 276.32 billion baht in 2019 with more than 18.6 million tourist. Tourist attractions in Chonburi, Thailand, can serve all types of visitors. The adventurous may choose to visit Khao Sam Muk, where there are a Chinese shrine and cactus Gardens on the hilltop and many wild monkeys along the hillsides. Chonburi is also a heaven for beach lovers, with hotspots like Bang Saen, Pattaya, and Ko Lan. Nong Mon Market is where you can shop for local souvenirs such as handcrafted products and delicious foods like Ho Mok or Thai steamed fish curry, Khao Lam or sweet sticky rice in bamboo, sweet banana and taro chips, and candied fruits.

                         The raw pictures which would be applied by the neural style transfer method to preduce the digital art.

In this project, I applied the current picture dataset with pretrained Arbitrary Image Stylization model - artistic style transfer with neural networks proposed a slow optimization algorithm that works on any arbitrary painting from **Tensorflow Hub** to create the generatived digital arts the concepts of **"Neural Style Transfer"**. This model is published by Google. Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.
