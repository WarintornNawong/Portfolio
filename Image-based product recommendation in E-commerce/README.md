# Image-based Product Recommendation in E-commerce
## Introduction
Product images provide a better first impression. According to a survey, more than **63 percent ** of consumers say that good product images are more important than product descriptions.
For an e-commerce platform, good quality product images are instrumental in convincing shoppers to buy. Product images can help shoppers to get a better virtual “feel” about the product and engage on a deeper level.

#### DATASET : 
Collection of over 2900 product images under Apparel and Footwear category. Two gender types Boys and Girls under Apparel, similarly Men and Women under Footwear.
Each image is identified by an unique ID(ProductId) like 10054.
fashion.csv contains additional details about the products like title, description, category, gender etc. you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikashrajluhaniwal/fashion-images)

## Model
- **Pairwise Distances**
Given a measure of the distance between each pair of species, a simple approach to the phylogeny problem would be to find a tree that predicts the observed set of distances as closely as possible. This leaves out some of the information in the data matrix M, reducing it to a simple table of pairwise distances. However, it seems that in many cases most of the evolutionary information is conveyed in these distances.

## Results
- Recommend No.1
