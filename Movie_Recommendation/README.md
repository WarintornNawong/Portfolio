# Movie Recommendation
### Introduction
According to a McKinsey report, 35% of Amazon.com's revenue is generated by its recommendation engine and 80% of Netflix viewer activity is driven by personalised recommendations. These figure encourage me to develop a recommendation engine in my favourite areas like a movie to build a tools to provide new watcher to give a similar movie based on thier content such as genres, director, actor etc. and provide similarity patterns, reviews and feedbacks between ex-user who likely to favour the identical movie.

### DATASET
- The Kaggle Datasource of 5000 TMDB Movie Data in [link](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/blob/main/Movie_Recommendation/Movie%20Recommendation.ipynb)
- The Movie Dataset Review in [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)

### Key Findings

This step is to extract the data from list-form dataframe for content-based recommendation into four individual attribute in the following detail,

- **Lead** : The three main cast who plays the role of the protagonist or leading role of a film.
- **Director** : The person who has a *key role* in choosing the cast members, production design and all the creative aspects of filmmaking.
- **Genres** : The Stylistic or thematic category for motion pictures based on similarities either in the narrative elements, aesthetic approach, or the emotional response to the film such as Action,Adventure,Fantasy,Science,Fiction etc.
- **Keyword** : a word or a sort of phrase that can be associated with plot of films.

### Which director has produced in the most movies ? and in the most movies's genres ?

Steven Spielberg ranked the top for the most producing filme director with many films such as Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones etc. and Woody Allen ranked second MANHATTAN, MIDNIGHT IN PARIS etc. and he is also produce the same genres movie in "Comedy" for more than 17 movies. As Drama film king, Martin scorsese ranked in thirdth highest film producing and higest drama producing director for 5000 TMDB Database

### Which is the most used keywords in the movies and director plot ?

The relationship is the most frequent keyword in movie plot due to it could become popular in every view group and it is also contemporary in every era. John Glen who is the director of James Bond  unsurprising use the secret keyword in his movie.

## Which actor has starred in the most movies ?

The result showed the most starred movie is "Robert De", "Matt Damon" and "Bruce Willis"

## Which is the most popular genres in the movies and the most actor's movie genres ?

The Drama movie is also popular with same reason as relationship becuase it is contemporary in every era.  

## Content-based Recommendation
To recommend based on the content similarity, the data would be required to convert into matrix and provide the information of the data thourgh "term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency(tf-idf)" approach and select the cosine similarity appilication to be a score for each film aspect. I named the score as Similarity score and calculate based on the following methodology. The coefficient of each parameter was derived from fine-tuning of the results of content recommendation which I found out that *Keyword* play the major role to deliver the highest efficiency in "Movie Recommendation".

**Similarity Score** = 0.4 * keyword + 0.3 * lead + 0.2 * director + 0.1 * genres

## Collaborative-Filtering Recommendation

 This step is to premilimary search for the top three collaborative-filtering algorithm with least accuracy measured by 'RMSE' in movie rating prediction based on cross validation approach between algorithm provided in *"SURPRISE"* library in the following type:
- **Matrix Factorization approach** : Singular Value Decompition (SVD), Singular Value Decompition (SVD++) ,nmf non negative matrix factorization (NMF).
- **KNN Species** : KNNBasic, KNNWithMeans,KNNWithZScore,KNNBaseline.
- **Others** : SlopeOne, NormalPredictor, BaselineONly

   The result showed that the top three algorithm in terms of least Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are "SVD++,BaselineOnly, SVD". Therefore, those algorithm would be selected for fine-tuning and compare with the best parameter to finalize the best appropriate algorithm for this dataset.

### Fine-Tuning
This step is to compare between the selected algorithm for finding the best algorithm with best paramater with "GridSearchCV" and measure it within the test set. The post-fine tuning parameter is shown below, 

- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** : {'n_factors': 25, 'n_epochs': 25, 'lr_all': 0.008, 'reg_all': 0.1} with RMSE 0.9181
- **Singalua value Decomposition plusplus (SVD++)** : {'n_factors': 30, 'n_epochs': 15, 'lr_all': 0.008, 'reg_all': 0.02} with RMSE 0.9129
- **Base Line Options : Alternating Least Square (ALS)** : {'bsl_options': {'method': 'als', 'n_epochs': 10, 'lr_all': 0.002, 'reg_all': 0.4}} with RMSE 0.9194

With these step, I found out that the best algorithm is "SVP++" with rmse is 0.9129 for test set. Therefore, I decided to select this algorithm for "Individual User Movie Rating Prediction".

## Hybrid Recommendation
This step is to merge between the similarity score for being a representative score for each film with and indivudual movie rating prediction which is range between 0 to 5.0 to construct the personalised score with following methodology:

**Personalised Favourite Score** = Similarity Score * prediction Rating / 2.5
