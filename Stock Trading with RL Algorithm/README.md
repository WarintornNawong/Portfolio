# Stock Trading with RL Algorithm
## Introduction
### DATASET
I used the data from yahoo finance (yfinance offers a threaded and Pythonic way to download market data from Yahoo!â“‡ finance.) to track the price history of "Games Stop Corporation" during 16 March 2020 to 12 March 2021.
**GameStop Corp.** is an American video game, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise retailer.The company is headquartered in Grapevine, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), and is the largest video game retailer worldwide

## Part II : Environment Creation 
To build the trading environment, I used the "gym-anytrading" library to apply RL algorithm to beat the Game Stop Corp trading.


## Part III : Algorithm Training
Three algorithm from "Stable Baseline-3" library was used to participate in trading environment which is specifeid below,
- Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)
- Deep Q Network (DQN)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

## Results 
Test period : 01 April - 01 October 2020.
