# The Data Science Portfolio
 This repository are collection of my portfolio in data science hands-on project, consist of "Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning Approach".
 
## Machine Learning 
- [Movie Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/tree/main/Movie_Recommendation) : Built a movie recommendation system with Hybrid Approach  by combining collaborative-filtering algorithms in Surprise library (Simple Python RecommendatIon System Engine) such as SVD,SVD++,NMF etc. for predicting user preferences score in movie rating combining with content-based recommendation from Top 5000 movies in the movie database (TMDB).   
- [Company Bankruptcy Prediction](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/tree/main/Bankruptcy%20Prediction) : Predicted a potential bankruptcy company from previous financial ratios such as ROA ,Operating Profit Rate etc. of the Taiwan Economic Journal during 1999â€“2009, and find the most relevant financial information for indicating company surviability from ensemble-based algorithm such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting etc.    
- [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/tree/main/Customer_Churn_Prediction) : Predicted a potential churn customer from a given customer demographics, and customer service information of telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3.
- [New Flight Route Recommendation](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/tree/main/Airport_Route_Analysis) : Built an airport route recommendation with "Open Triangles" in Social network analysis from  Openflight Airport base data and route data in 2014 and 2017.

## Deep learning
- [Weather Classification](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/blob/main/Weather%20Classification/README.md) : Predicted Weather condition (Sunrise, Rain, Cloudy and Shrine) from Multi-class weather dataset by applying pre-trained model Deep Residual Network (ResNet50)
- [Digital Art Generation from Chonburi's Landmark](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/tree/main/Digital_Art_Museum) : Produced digital art from four major Chonburi City's landmark or tourist attractive locaion  (Chonburi , Bangseun , Sriracha and  Pattaya City) by applying "Neural Style Transfer" from Pre-trained Arbitrary Image Stylization model at Tensorflow-Hub.
- [Image-based Product Recommendation in E-commerce](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/tree/main/Image-based%20product%20recommendation%20in%20E-commerce)) : Built a image-based similarity recommendation system of the product images under Apparel and Footwear category at e-commerce services with similarities-based picture with pre-trained model (ResNet50).
- [Command Audio Classification](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/tree/main/Command%20Audio%20Classification) : Predicted the Command by Recognizing the audio from speech command dataset i.e. Up, Down, Left, Right etc. with Deep Neural Network.
- [Airline Tweet Sentiment Prediction](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/blob/main/Airline%20Tweet%20Sentiment%20Prediction/README.md) : Predicted tweet sentiment (Neutral, Positive and Negative) from U.S. Airline dataset at February 2015.

## Reinforcement Learning
- [Stock Trading with RL Algorithm](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/tree/main/Stock%20Trading%20with%20RL%20Algorithm) : To build stock trading with stable-baseline3 library's algorithm - A2C,DQN,PPO.
- [BackJack Card Strategy Formulation](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/tree/main/BlackJack%20Card%20Strategy%20Formulation) : Formulate the strategy for "BlackJack Card Games" with RL algorithm (Q-Learning, SARSA, Expected-SARSA, Monte Carlo Exploring Start, Monte Carlo Control).
- [Beat Pendulum gameplay with RL algorithm](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/tree/main/Beat%20Pendulum%20gameplay%20with%20RL%20algorithm)
