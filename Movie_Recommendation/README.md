# Movie Recommendation
### Introduction
According to a McKinsey report, 35% of Amazon.com's revenue is generated by its recommendation engine and 80% of Netflix viewer activity is driven by personalised recommendations. These figure encourage me to develop a recommendation engine in my favourite areas like a movie to build a tools to provide new watcher to give a similar movie based on thier content such as genres, director, actor etc. and provide similarity patterns, reviews and feedbacks between ex-user who likely to favour the identical movie.
