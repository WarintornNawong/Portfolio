# The Data Science Portfolio
 This repository are my portfolio in data science hands-on project 
 
## Machine Learning 
- [Movie Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/tree/main/Movie_Recommendation) : Built a movie recommendation system with Hybrid Approach  by combining collaborative-filtering algorithms in Surprise library (Simple Python RecommendatIon System Engine) such as SVD,SVD++,NMF etc. for predicting user preferences score in movie rating combining with content-based recommendation from Top 5000 movies in the movie database (TMDB).   
- [Company Bankruptcy Prediction](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/tree/main/Bankruptcy%20Prediction) : Predicted a potential bankruptcy company from previous financial ratios such as ROA ,Operating Profit Rate etc. of the Taiwan Economic Journal during 1999â€“2009, and find the most relevant financial information for indicating company surviability from ensemble-based algorithm such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting etc.    
- [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/tree/main/Customer_Churn_Prediction) : Perdicted a potential churn customer from a given customer demographics, and customer service information of telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3.
- [New Flight Route Recommendation](https://github.com/WarintornNawong/Portfolio/tree/main/Airport_Route_Analysis) : Built an airport route recommendation with "Open Triangles" in Social network analysis from
