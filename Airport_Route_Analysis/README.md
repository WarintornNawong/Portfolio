# Airport Route Network Analysis and New Route Recommendation
## Introduction
If you are the airline businessman, you have to know how complexity of airport route network, and the influence of airport location in order to plan or launch the new commercial route to boost competitiveness in airline industry. The main solution is to apply social network analysis to visualize the holistic viewpoint in "Aerial or Satellite View" and measure the centrality indicator to formulate the airline hub strategy alonside with further available data such as number of passenger, geopolitics and sizing of airplane etc. Therefore, i would like to make a tools to measure preliminary recommendation with the "Open Triangle" algorithm to airline business owner. 
### DATASET
- Airport Database from Openflight [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyanshrai/openflights-airports-database-2017)
- Route Network Database from Openflight [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyanshrai/openflights-route-database-2014)
## Algorithm
Triadic closure is a concept in social network theory and it is the property among three nodes A, B, and C (representing people, for instance), such that if a *strong tie* exists between A-B and A-C, there is a weak or strong tie between B-C. This property is too extreme to hold true across very large, complex networks, but it is a useful simplification of reality that can be used to understand and predict networks.
